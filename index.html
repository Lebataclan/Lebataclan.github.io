		<h1>Why Rugby? and why chess, those are completely different things</h1>
		<p> Well I like rugby because, as it may not seem like it, it is quite tactical and is a tough sport, also there is a group spirit and you can make lots of good friends with this nice atmosphere.
		    And chess, well my dad thought me how to play the hard way, which means by crushing me every game we played, and I really don't like to loose, so I practiced to get better and better at it to a point where I could beat him, which happened, but now both of us are at the same level. </section>
		thanks for reading and take some potato for the long post:
